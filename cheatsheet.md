# Reliability Engineering Comprehensive Reference

## Fundamental Concepts

### Reliability Definition
- Reliability (R(t)) is the probability that a system will perform its intended function under stated conditions for a specified period of time
- Unreliability (F(t)) = $1 - R(t)$
- Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) = $\frac{\text{Total Operating Time}}{\text{Number of Failures}}$
- Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) - Used for non-repairable systems
- Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) - Average time required to repair a failed component

### Availability Metrics
- Availability (A) = $\frac{\text{MTTF}}{\text{MTTF} + \text{MTTR}}$
- Inherent Availability (Ai) = $\frac{\text{MTTF}}{\text{MTTF} + \text{MTTR}}$
- Operational Availability (Ao) = $\frac{\text{Operating Time}}{\text{Operating Time} + \text{Downtime}}$
- Achieved Availability (Aa) = $\frac{\text{MTTF}}{\text{MTTF} + \bar{M}}$
where $\bar{M}$ is mean active maintenance time

## Probability Distributions in Reliability

### Exponential Distribution
- Most commonly used for constant failure rate systems
- Probability Density Function: f(t) = $\lambda e^{-\lambda t}$
- Reliability Function: R(t) = $e^{-\lambda t}$
- Failure Rate: $\lambda(t) = \lambda$ (constant)
- MTTF = $1/\lambda$

### Weibull Distribution
- Most versatile distribution in reliability engineering
- Three-Parameter Form:
  - f(t) = $(\beta/\eta)((t-\gamma)/\eta)^{(\beta-1)}exp(-((t-\gamma)/\eta)^\beta)$
- Parameters:
  - $\beta$ (Beta): Shape parameter
  - $\eta$ (Eta): Scale parameter
  - $\gamma$ (Gamma): Location parameter
- Reliability Function: R(t) = $exp(-((t-\gamma)/\eta)^\beta)$
- Characteristics:
  - $\beta < 1$: Decreasing failure rate
  - $\beta = 1$: Constant failure rate (reduces to exponential)
  - $\beta > 1$: Increasing failure rate

### Normal Distribution
- Used for wear-out failures
- Probability Density Function: f(t) = $(1/(\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}))e^{-(t-\mu)^2/(2\sigma^2)}$
- Parameters:
  - $\mu$: Mean life
  - $\sigma$: Standard deviation

### Lognormal Distribution
- Used for repair times and maintenance actions
- PDF: f(t) = $(1/(t\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}))e^{-(\ln(t)-\mu)^2/(2\sigma^2)}$
- Where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and standard deviation of ln(t)

## System Reliability Analysis

### Series Systems
- Overall Reliability: $R_s = R_1 \times R_2 \times ... \times R_n$
- System fails if any component fails
- MTTF(system) = $1/(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + ... + \lambda_n)$

### Parallel Systems
- Overall Reliability: $R_p = 1 - [(1-R_1) \times (1-R_2) \times ... \times (1-R_n)]$
- System functions if at least one component works
- Improves system reliability

### k-out-of-n Systems
- System works if at least k components out of n work
- Reliability: $R(k,n) = \sum_{i=k}^n \binom{n}{i}R^i(1-R)^{n-i}$

## Failure Analysis

### Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
- Risk Priority Number (RPN) = Severity × Occurrence × Detection
- Scale typically 1-10 for each factor
- Higher RPN indicates higher risk

### Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)
Basic Events Symbols:

- Circle: Basic event
- Diamond: Undeveloped event
- Rectangle: Intermediate event
- House: External event

Gate Symbols:

- AND gate: Output occurs if all inputs occur
- OR gate: Output occurs if any input occurs
- Exclusive OR gate: Output occurs if exactly one input occurs

### Common Cause Failures (CCF)
- Beta Factor Model: CCF = $\beta \times \lambda$
where $\beta$ is the fraction of failures that are common cause

## Maintenance Strategies

### Preventive Maintenance
- Time-Based Maintenance (TBM)
- Usage-Based Maintenance (UBM)
- Optimal Maintenance Interval: $T^* = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times C_p}{C_f \times \lambda}}$
where:
- $C_p$ = Preventive maintenance cost
- $C_f$ = Failure repair cost
- $\lambda$ = Failure rate

### Condition-Based Maintenance
- P-F Interval: Time between potential failure detection and functional failure
- Key Parameters:
  - Inspection interval < P-F interval
  - Cost of monitoring < Cost of failure × Probability of failure

### Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM)
Seven Questions:
1. Functions and performance standards
2. Functional failures
3. Failure modes
4. Failure effects
5. Failure consequences
6. Proactive tasks
7. Default actions

## Testing and Confidence

  where C = confidence level, R = required reliability
- For binomial success/failure: $n = \frac{\ln(1-C)}{\ln(1-p)}$
  where p = probability of failure

### Confidence Calculations

## Design of Experiments

### Taguchi Methods
- Signal-to-noise ratios:
  - Larger is better: $S/N = -10\log(\frac{1}{n}\sum\frac{1}{y_i^2})$
  - Nominal is best: $S/N = 10\log(\frac{\bar{y}^2}{s^2})$
  - Smaller is better: $S/N = -10\log(\frac{1}{n}\sum y_i^2)$

### Loss Functions
- Quality loss: $L(y) = k(y - T)^2$
  where T = target value, k = cost coefficient
- Process capability indices:
  - $C_p = \frac{USL-LSL}{6\sigma}$
  - $C_{pk} = min(\frac{USL-\mu}{3\sigma}, \frac{\mu-LSL}{3\sigma})$

## Statistical Life Measures

### B-Life Analysis
- B-life: Time at which X% of units have failed
- For Normal Distribution:
  - $B_x = \mu + z_p\sigma$
  where $z_p$ is standard normal value at $(x/100)$ probability
- For Weibull Distribution:
  - $B_x = \eta[-\ln(1-x/100)]^{1/\beta}$

### Population Parameters

  - $\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\chi^2_{\alpha/2}} \leq \sigma^2 \leq \frac{(n-1)s^2}{\chi^2_{1-\alpha/2}}$
- Population Mean Confidence Interval:
  - $\bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2,n-1}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$

## Acceleration Testing

### Common Models
1. Arrhenius (Temperature):
   - $AF = exp[\frac{E_a}{k}(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2})]$
2. Coffin-Manson (Mechanical Stress):
   - $AF = (\frac{\Delta\varepsilon_1}{\Delta\varepsilon_2})^m$
3. Inverse Power Law (Stress):
   - $AF = (\frac{S_1}{S_2})^n$
4. Eyring (Multiple Stresses):
   - $AF = (\frac{T_1}{T_2})exp[\frac{B}{k}(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}) + C(V_1-V_2)]$

## Reliability Growth Models

### AMSAA-Duane Model
- Cumulative Failures: $N(t) = \lambda t^\beta$
- Instantaneous Failure Rate: $r(t) = \lambda\beta t^{\beta-1}$
- Cumulative Failure Rate: $r_c(t) = \lambda t^{\beta-1}$
- Cumulative MTBF: $M_c(t) = \frac{1}{\lambda}t^{1-\beta}$

## Spare Parts Analysis

### Poisson Process Spares
- Probability of x spares needed: $P(X=x) = \frac{(\lambda t)^x e^{-\lambda t}}{x!}$
- Probability of more than n spares: $P(X>n) = 1 - \sum_{x=0}^n \frac{(\lambda t)^x e^{-\lambda t}}{x!}$

### System with Spares
- Reliability with n spares: $R_s(t) = e^{-\lambda t}\sum_{i=0}^n \frac{(\lambda t)^i}{i!}$
- Mean Time To System Failure: $MTSF = \frac{1}{\lambda}\sum_{i=0}^{n+1} i$
